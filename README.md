# Overview

This repository provides notes, code and suggested readings for Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning. These are meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical material from

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)
- [CS 330: Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning](http://cs330.stanford.edu/)

Each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above textbook and/or course. In addition to exercises and solution, each folder also contains a list of learning goals, a brief concept summary, notes made during class and links to the relevant readings.

All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Advanced techniques use [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) for neural network implementations.
